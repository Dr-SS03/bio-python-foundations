# Bio Python Foundations

Learning Python from zero with a biotech focus.

This repository documents foundational Python skills applied to biological datasets such as RNA-seq and gene expression matrices.

## Day 1 – Gene Expression Matrix

- Created simulated RNA-seq count matrix
- Computed mean expression across samples
- Applied log2 transformation (common RNA-seq preprocessing step)
- Sorted genes by expression level

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.11
- pandas
- numpy
- Jupyter Notebook

---

This is the beginning of a structured roadmap toward:
- Bulk RNA-seq differential expression
- Single-cell RNA-seq analysis
- Reproducible genomics workflows
